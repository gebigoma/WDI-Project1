## Introduction to Dream Recall
This game will be testing your memory skills. The player is presented with a collection of images to remember. The screen takes them to a larger collection of images with the previous images hidden within. They must choose best to their memory. There is a time limit to view and choose images. The players take turns and the one with the most matched images wins the round. 

## Rules
There are no hard rules. The game doesn't allow any other functions other than clicking to read the instructions, start the game, and choose their selection of images. 

## Mouse Click to Play Game

## Issues Faced

1. A major issue I had was with trying to get some of the functions to work synchronously. The player rounds are set in timeouts and intervals and there was a lot of confusion setting up the functions to work in the order I needed. 
2. Another issue I had was with scoping. The variables were not defined with the proper scope which caused some bugs. 

## Backlog
  * My backlog includes some jQuery animations that I was not able to do due to the nature of synchronous coding and the way that my timeouts and intervals were set up.
