1) What went well?

Workflow went well. Quickly deciding on the game, drawing up the wireframe and then diving straight into JS and focusing on that for the majority of the week and leaving the design last. 

2) What could be improved?

I got stuck with the synchronous coding and although I had the answer I thought that I should figure out how to make it work the way I wanted instead of settling with the answer I had. I thought my answer was not a good solution and instead spent 2 whole days stressing out.

3) What's something you learned?

Synchronous vs asynchronous coding.
